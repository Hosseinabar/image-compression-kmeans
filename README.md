# image-compression-kmeans

Kmeans is a simple and well known clustering algorithm, but very useful in many applications.
one of its usecases is image compressing, kind of interesting,let's see how.

An image is made up of many colors, if we use RGB model then each color can be represented as 24 bits (8 bit for each main color)
in digital world and there would be a huge space of possible colors, if we could reduce this space somehow then each color would be 
represented in only 16 or 8 or evern 2 bits hence we would have too smaller images in size.
